I am a staff algorithm engineer in DAMO Academy, Alibaba Group. 

My research lies in the theoretical and algorithmic foundations in optimization, signal processing, machine learning, and data science. In particular, I currently focus on the development of fast, scalable, reliable, and distributed algorithms with applications in large-scale optimization, deep neural network training, federated learning, and Internet of things.  

I was the recipient of several academic awards, including the 2017 IEEE Signal Processing Society Young Author Best Paper Award, and the 2017 ICCM Distinguished Paper Award. 

Now I am working in the Decision Intelligence Lab in Alibaba led by Prof. Wotao Yin. Before that, I completed my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from University of California, Los Angeles in 2019, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Ali H. Sayed. I received my M. E. from University of Science and Technology of China in 2014 supervised by Prof. Qing Ling, and B. E. from Xidian University in 2011.
