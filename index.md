<br>

I am a staff algorithm engineer in DAMO Academy, Alibaba Group. 

My research lies in the theoretical and algorithmic foundations in optimization, signal processing, machine learning, and data science. I currently focus on the development of fast, scalable, reliable, and distributed algorithms with applications in large-scale optimization, deep neural network training, federated learning, and Internet of things.  

I was the recipient of several academic awards, including the 2017 IEEE Signal Processing Society Young Author Best Paper Award, and the 2017 ICCM Distinguished Paper Award. 

Now I am working in the [Decision Intelligence Lab](https://damo.alibaba.com/labs/decision-intelligence) in Alibaba led by Prof. [Wotao Yin](https://wotaoyin.mathopt.com/). Before that, I completed my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [University of California, Los Angeles](https://www.ucla.edu/) in 2019, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Ali H. Sayed](https://asl.epfl.ch/biography/). I received my M. E. degree from [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) in 2014 supervised by Prof. [Qing Ling](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=u70vRDYAAAAJ&hl=en), and B. E. degree from Xidian University in 2011.
