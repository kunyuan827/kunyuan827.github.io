I am a staff algorithm engineer in DAMO Academy, Alibaba Group. 

My research lies in the theoretical and algorithmic foundations in optimization, signal processing, machine learning, and data science. I currently focus on the development of fast, scalable, reliable, and distributed algorithms with applications in large-scale optimization, deep neural network training, federated learning, and Internet of things.  

<!-- I was the recipient of several academic awards, including the prestigious 2017 IEEE Signal Processing Society Young Author Best Paper Award, and the 2017 ICCM Distinguished Paper Award.  -->

Now I am working in the [Decision Intelligence Lab](https://damo.alibaba.com/labs/decision-intelligence) in Alibaba led by Prof. [Wotao Yin](https://wotaoyin.mathopt.com/). Before that, I completed my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)](https://www.ucla.edu/) in 2019, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Ali H. Sayed](https://asl.epfl.ch/biography/). I was a visiting researcher at [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) from 2018 January to 2018 June, and a research intern at [Microsoft Research Redmond](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/deep-learning-group/) from 2018 June to 2018 October.

I was the recipient of the <mark style="background-color: lightblue">2017 IEEE Signal Processing Society Young Author Best Paper Award </mark> (joint with Dr. [Wei Shi](https://sites.google.com/view/wilburshi/home)), and the **2017 ICCM Distinguished Paper Award**.
