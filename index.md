<br>

I am an Assistant Professor at [Center for Machine Learning Research (CMLR)](https://cmlr.pku.edu.cn/) in Peking University. 

My research lies in the theoretical and algorithmic foundations in optimization, signal processing, machine learning, and data science. I currently focus on the development of fast, scalable, reliable, and distributed algorithms with applications in large-scale optimization, deep neural network training, federated learning, and Internet of things.  

<!-- I was the recipient of several academic awards, including the prestigious 2017 IEEE Signal Processing Society Young Author Best Paper Award, and the 2017 ICCM Distinguished Paper Award.  -->

Before joining Peking University, I was a staff algorithm engineer in the [Decision Intelligence Lab](https://damo.alibaba.com/labs/decision-intelligence) in Alibaba (US) Group led by Prof. [Wotao Yin](https://wotaoyin.mathopt.com/). I completed my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)](https://www.ucla.edu/) in 2019 under the supervision of Prof. [Ali H. Sayed](https://asl.epfl.ch/biography/). I was a visiting researcher at [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) from 2018 January to 2018 June, and a research intern at [Microsoft Research Redmond](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/deep-learning-group/) from 2018 June to 2018 October.

I was the recipient of the *2017 IEEE Signal Processing Society Young Author Best Paper Award* (joint with Dr. [Wei Shi](https://sites.google.com/view/wilburshi/home)), and the *2017 ICCM Distinguished Paper Award*.

<mark> We have opennings for PostDocs, PhD students, Master students, and Undergraduate research interns. Drop me an email if you are interested in machine learning, optimization, and AI systems.</mark> <br>
