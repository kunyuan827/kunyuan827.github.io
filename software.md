## BlueFog: A Decentralized Framework for Optimization and Deep Learning [[Github]](https://github.com/Bluefog-Lib/bluefog)

Decentralized optimization algorithms are low-communication-overhead alternatives to traditional distributed algorithms using a center to conduct global average. However, the lack of an easy-to-use and efficient software package has kept most decentralized algorithms merely on paper. BlueFog is the first python library for straightforward, high-performance implementations of diverse decentralized algorithms.
