## BlueFog: A Decentralized Framework for Optimization and Deep Learning [Github](https://github.com/Bluefog-Lib)

Decentralized optimization algorithms are low-communication-overhead alternatives to traditional distributed algorithms using a center to conduct global average. However, the lack of an easy-to-use and efficient software package has kept most decentralized algorithms merely on paper. BlueFog is the first python library for straightforward, high-performance implementations of diverse decentralized algorithms. 

<!-- It is open source at \url{https://github.com/Bluefog-Lib}. BlueFog was invited to give keynote lectures in the US East Coast Optimization Meeting 2021 and China Symposium on Machine Learning 2020.  -->
